## Project Overview

This repository contains multiple versions of my resume, each implemented as a separate HTML file (resume1.html through resume8.html). The aim is to showcase different styles and layouts while practicing HTML and CSS for web development.

The central CSS file (style.css) is used to maintain consistent styling across all resume versions. It includes rules for fonts, colors, layouts, and other visual elements.
